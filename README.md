## 🔍 Explore Design Patterns
ShowTVTime-Design-Patterns is built using a strict 3-layer architecture. This structure helps in organizing the application effectively. Here is a brief overview:

- **Presentation Layer**: This is the user interface, where you interact with the application. It displays information and collects user input.
- **Business Logic Layer**: This layer processes the input from the presentation layer and executes the necessary operations, such as adding media files and managing user connections.
- **Data Layer**: All data is stored and retrieved through this layer. It manages databases or file systems that hold your media files and other information.

The application employs various design patterns to ensure efficient management and flexibility:

- **Strategy Pattern**: This allows different algorithms to be defined and encapsulated, making it easy to switch between them without modifying the code.
- **Facade Pattern**: This simplifies the interface that users interact with, hiding the complexities behind it.
- **Factory Pattern**: This creates objects without specifying the exact class of object that will be created, promoting loose coupling.

## 📖 User Guide
Once the application is running, you will see a main window with several options:

- **Add Media**: Click this button to upload your media files.
- **Manage Community**: Access features that help you connect with other users.
- **Settings**: Customize your experience by modifying various options.
